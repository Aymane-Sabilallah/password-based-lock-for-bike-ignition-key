## Software Design

The software for this project is written in C and compiled using Keil uVision5. The main functionalities include:

- Initializing the microcontroller and peripherals.
- Reading input from the keypad.
- Displaying messages on the LCD.
- Controlling the relay based on password verification.

### Code Structure

The code is structured into several key functions:

1. **Initialization**: Set up the microcontroller and peripherals.
2. **Password Input**: Capture user input from the keypad.
3. **Password Verification**: Check if the entered password matches the stored password.
4. **Relay Control**: Activate the relay if the password is correct.

## Installation
